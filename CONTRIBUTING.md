## Branches

[lategenxer.streamlit.app](https://lategenxer.streamlit.app/) serves the tool from the `main`
branch.

## Getting started

Install [uv](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv), then serve the calculator locally by running:

```shell
uv venv
uv pip install -r requirements-dev.txt
uv run streamlit run Home.py
```

This should start serving the tool locally.
