## Branches

[lategenxer.streamlit.app](https://lategenxer.streamlit.app/) serves the tool from the `main`
branch.

## Getting started

Follow the [Streamlit installation
guide](https://docs.streamlit.io/library/get-started/installation), using
`pipenv` as environment management tool.

Serve the calculator locally by running

```shell
pipenv run streamlit run Home.py
```

This should start serving the tool locally.
