#   "If a participant disposes of an interest in a reporting period and S106A
#   TCGA 1992 (Identification of securities: capital gains tax) applies to
#   identify the whole or part of that interest with an interest acquired in
#   the next reporting period, then the disposal is ignored and the participant
#   is treated as having held that interest at the end of the earlier period.
#   (regulation 94(3A))."

#   "Note: If you sell your shares and buy them back within a 30-day period
#   (and this activity straddles the reporting period end) youâ€™ll still need to
#   calculate ERI for your holding, as if you continued to hold the shares at
#   the reporting period end."
